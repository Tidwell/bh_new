stereotypes

Earth - conservative
Mars - explorers (risk takers)
moon - mediators (balance, but dull)


each character fights against the next

"the inventor"
a man caught up in business, dreaming of the betterment of society, facing the preasures of success.
meets the star, who realizes her power, and uses it wisely....


The inventor created station+,for data research - having purely sterile conditions generates amazing
market data, and further technological development.  Major companies of the world pledged giant
funds to create the station+ - a scientific, cultural, playground high above earth - filled with
the brightest minds.

"5 year old Stephanie just finished calculus 1, is your child behind?"
"All of the world's elite were either up there, out there, or somewhere"

"the star"
"I grew up with holoperformances from the star" - the tramp
...and gains much success, but loses it with age due to financial concerns, always more important
than beauty, looking to...

the first spacers (spacers->future ruling mooninites)

(the station (2089), moon (2120), and mars(2140))

"the tramp"
..exploit the middle class, stary-eyed due to 'the star', but facing cruel reality when they
walk off the ship


mars was originally "the middle class planet"

The major investors had gained primary interest in the major world governments, and were residence the moon 
colony (along with the future ruling mooninites), however exploiting mars colony and other planets
was where all the money was was to be made.

"the businessman"
the man who was oblivious, dealing with personal problems (earthly problems), who protected the attrocities
to further the positives, justifying the end regardless of the means.

The investing companies accrued huge profits through discoveries, grants, and government and private
contracts.  Though the majority of their profit was through undisclosed means.  Each and every occupant
of the three initial colonies was having their every move and action tracked and sold to the highest bidder for aiding in any number of different research. Further medical and scientific tests (genetic alterations, brain analysis, high risk conditions, untreated disease and illness for the purpose of study, the super rich could subscribe - know/watch every move, 
action - e-stalk, for a hefty price)

"the savior"
a smooth talking lawyer, as much after their own success, and a terrorist leader, after revenge.  some kind
of collaboration

The invasion of human rights was exposed in 2185, and resulted in a major uprising from the people
of mars, the station, and the moon colony.  "Earth" resisted (controlled from the men on the moon, who
considered themsleves peacekeepers), resulting in the data rebellion (2186-2190).  In the end, 
the rebels were successful in several victories, exposing the atrocities of many of the mooninites.

As a result,many major earth governments fell (who were puppets to mooninites), and mars was put under their own governance (though the affair further sewed the seeds of distrust between the martians and the "corrupt" earthers)

"the scientist"
silver-spooned, oblivious of the previous attrocities out to better humanity.  a reasurgence of faith in humanity's
contribution

In 2280, a wormhole was discovered on the edge of the SOL system, linking us to the rest of the galaxy.  

It fosterd trade, culture, and prosperity - for a time.  The old rivalries
began to surface between mars and the earthers as the newfound wealth of intergalactic possibilities opened up - many of the businesses of earth wanted to exploit the newfound riches of the universe, fostering corruption amongst the ruling body.

Mars, fearing the continued corruption of earth, and their 2nd fiddle role, promoted separation and actively refused any attempts to result in a trade agreement.

"the politician"
sacraficing when needed, making hard choices, duped with the best intentions.


When major players for mars and earth, residing on the moon colony attempted to bring several alien cultures together for trade talks (2340), terrorist action caused the deaths of several leaders, each blaming the other.

The resulting earth-martian war (2342-2360), played out on the doorsteps of the SOL system and left much of humanity
defenseless, as the factions' attempts to control the wormhole through Alien aid resulted in
the death of billions, leaving them easy pickings for the less resputable alien cultures.


Two species were connected to gateway, the earth supporters controlled the gateway.  The martian supporters,
who had an ancient history of being at war with the earthen supporters hoped the martians would gain control
of the SOL system, and in turn drive the earthen supportors out of gateway (giving them the more lucrative trade routes).

In the end, they both watched humanity tear itself apart, and instead united, posing as peace-keepers, to replace the human leadership wiht puppets and reign over the SOL system, turing humanity into second-class citizens



"the peacekeeper" 

a puppet, socialist, ends justify means, dispite regret (repeat of the businessman)


The government of earth was replaced with puppets, ruled by a shadow government of the Aliens.

Many of the mars colony (and saturn, or whatever other planets/colonies the explorers had populated since
2520) rebelled, and were enslaved, forced to mine in our asteroid belt for valuable minerals to be
shipped through the wormhole (aliens justified due to constant terrorist action by the martians).


After the extradition of the Earth government, and the irradication of the Mars populus, the alien races
began to divvy up the SOL system.  

"the dreamer"
retrospective, the man who saw the future - realized humanity's failing and eventual re-united state.







<!-- GAME -->
2600


ACT I
The Delegation

The remaining leadership was quartered to the moon.  A hotbed of culture clash, political intrigue, and 
the last refuge of the ruling class of huminity.  Seeing the writing on the walls, the leaders
sent one colony ship through the wormhole, to ensure that the survival of the species, regardless of what
happended in the SOL system.  The ship was filled with composition from both earth and the mars colony (more hotbed)


"the masahiah"

You play the captian of the last bastion of humanity, attempting to find a new home for earth.
The leaders of the opposing factions are on board, and constantly give you disparate advice

/*think more about these goals*/
mars - show our force in the universe and take from others what has been taken from us
earth - establish relations in an attempt to seek aid to find a new home


~the tutorial takes you through the solar system (movement @ mars, combat @ asteroids)
~pick up a third ship, then 1 or 2 combat skirmishes on the way to the wormhole

must choose to go the route to the martian supporters or earthen supporters.  Realize you need to get a ship to get through the gateway (an old political friend from the war promises one from each side, choose)
~defense grid battle, homeworld battle (pick up fourth ship), wormhole battle

(whoops, didn't work), escape through the gateway to the central hub
~two gateway skirmishes

missions (9 played, 12 possible)



ACT IIa
The Journey

In search of a new home, the ship travels to several of the gateways connected to the central hub, each requesting some task.  All say they aren't aware of any inhabited planets, and are foreboding about the dark space and the all powerful aliens who inhabit it, who created the wormhole network.  They point out that many ships have entered never to return.


~1 hub of 2 planets [4 missions], 2 hubs of 3 planets [9 missions]
~convoy escort
~weapons demonstration & sales
~stop terrorist organization plot to take over a station
~salvage operation


After some time, you realize you need more information about dark space since its the only unexplored place connected to the Nexus.  An information broker at the nexus reveals the location of a subspace teliscope - if anyone knows about dark space, its them (her?).

~travel to subspace telliscope




missions (min 8 played, 17 possible)
1 connector [4 missions]


ACT III
The Dark Space

The captain decides to take the ship into the dark space, a region connected to the central hub via the dark gateway, which very few species travel to or from.

It is rumored that the inhabitance of the dark space are the race who originally created the wormhole network (the light and dark aliens).

traveling into the dark space, we learn that an alien bug race controls the center of the darkspace.  A hostile race that feel they own the dark space, they are at war with the red aliens, and the blue aliens have formed a perimiter defense grid, leaving a relative peace.  However the safety from the aliens inside the defense grid has lead to widespread looting, piracy and terrorism from other races within the nebula.

we are told that there is a wormhole at red/blue that connects to the founder gateway, if we journey back to the red/blue homeworld, we can gain access to the wormhole and an introduction with light/dark (depending on red/blue).

rumor of the civil war between light and dark permiates the story.


missions (20 possible)
tierd in an arc from the starting point

~space aliens attacks - junior (both) (connects to asteroid story or defense grid story)

BLUE
~help defend military outpost from bug aliens
~destroyed station battle vs scavengers
~hostage situation
~quell terrorist uprising and prevent a quantum warhead from being detonated on the home planet
~provide the bomb to the light aliens and deliver it to the dark alien homeworld

RED
~destroy asteroid hurtling towards planet launched from an alien bug-planet (escorted by evil flying aliens)
~help defeat the bug people, pushing them back to their home planet 
~the purging of the bug homeworld
~provide the asteroid weapon to the dark aliens and deliver it to the light alien homeworld


ACT IV
The Battle

eventually reach either the light or dark aliens, where the captain brokers an agreement to aid the aliens and to deliver the weapon in exchange for the planet orbiting the founder gateway. pick up 5th ship (from the indigenous friends)

traveling to the founder gateway, we battle in the middle of an interstellar civil war between the race whose ancestors created the wormhole network, then deliver the weapon to the opposing faction home planet, ending the war.

missions (5 played, 10 possible)

As compensation, the fiends are given control of the founder gateway, and the earthers the planet at the founder gateway, whose wormhole goes to a connector to each side of the dark space and the central hub (keep their new friends close).

2650
"the peacekeeper pt 2" (son of peacekeeper).
a planet ravaged by war, without lucrative reserves, constantly caught in the middle of the fight between the light and dark aliens.  It was satisfactory, but as time went by a deep unrest was felt over the expulsion from the 
SOL system and the constant bickering between the light and dark aliens, each supported by either the earthers or the martians.

2800
A single continent provided no separation, and through the help of the light/dark aliens, the martians returned to a segregated and less afluent life on the terraformed planet in the sector, attempting to establish peace, but pleasing no-one.  as they grew apart, the martians began to grow closer to the dark aliens,
the earthers closest to the light aliens.  For several years, there was little talk as the factions grew divided.



"the warrior"
3200 - Retake Earth
message is recieved that the alien species want to destory the sun to harvest as an energy source.  save the world?
to prevent the obliteration of our homeworld.


returning to SOL... all converge on earth at the same time - different routes work together in the end 








MECHANICS
******************************************************
(the chrome is based on the faction, all in a futuristic historical reenactment style)

move the academy, armory, merchant, and shipyard to the map screen, make sure one is accessable in every region.

the tutorial becomes the pattern, gain connections in a system - travel through that system - move forward.

skills usable in non-combat: those are perm skills. bartering, location agreements - these are the ones that are faction specific ?each skill choice presents a cut scene?

HUGE reward to player for skill choice  **

can diplomacy with the other factions expose better skills - varying faction loyalty?
